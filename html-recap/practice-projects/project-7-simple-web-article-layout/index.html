                <p class="para1">The Samurai were incredible warriors who have been revered for their nobility and frightening skills throughout history.
                    Though they did less than admirable things, the majority of the samurai were bound to the strict code known as "Bushido".

                <p class="para2">Bushido was made of 6 tenets for the Samurai warrior to uphold. Gi, Yuu, Jin, Makoto, Rei, Meiyo, Chuugi.
                    Should they break the code of Bushido, a great dishonor was placed on them. Fun Fact: The Samurai prferred the Yari and Naginata
                    to the Katana. The Katana was only used as a last resort.
